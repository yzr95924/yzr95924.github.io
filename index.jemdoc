== About me
Zuoru Yang got his Bachelor's degree from [http://www.cs.xjtu.edu.cn/ Department of Computer Science and Technology], [http://www.xjtu.edu.cn/ Xi'an Jiaotong University] in 2018.
In /XJTU/, he worked with Prof Peng Zhang to do the research about Software-Defined Network (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) (e.g. design debug/verification tool in SDN and NFV). Now, he is pursuing his PhD degree in [http://adslab.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/ ADSLab] (*A*pplied *D*istributed *S*ystem Lab) of The Chinese University of Hong Kong under the supervision by Prof [http://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/~pclee/www/index.html Patrick P. C. Lee]. \n
His research interests span Network Security and Distributed Storage System. Currently, he focuses on the topic of *Secure Deduplication* in cloud storage system.
